# Runbooks Directory

## Purpose

Operational procedures for handling common scenarios, incidents, and maintenance tasks.

## Available Runbooks

### `cost-incident-response.md`
What to do when costs exceed budget:
1. Immediate response (stop all batch jobs)
2. Identify high-cost operations
3. Implement cost controls
4. Resume operations with limits
5. Post-incident review

**Use when**: Cost alerts trigger, budget exceeded

### `cache-optimization.md`
Improve prompt cache efficiency:
1. Analyze cache hit rates
2. Identify low-performing prompts
3. Restructure for better caching
4. Measure improvement
5. Deploy optimized prompts

**Use when**: Cache hit rate < 80%, costs high

### `batch-operations.md`
Run non-interactive batch processing:
1. Prepare ticket queue
2. Configure batch limits (cost, concurrency)
3. Submit batch jobs
4. Monitor progress
5. Reconcile results
6. Handle failures

**Use when**: Processing many tickets offline

### `ticket-recovery.md`
Recover from failed implementations:
1. Identify failure point
2. Preserve partial work
3. Roll back if necessary
4. Fix root cause
5. Resume from checkpoint

**Use when**: Implementer fails mid-ticket

### `model-migration.md`
Migrate to new model versions:
1. Test new model with sample tickets
2. Compare costs and quality
3. Update routing rules
4. Gradual rollout (canary deployment)
5. Monitor regressions

**Use when**: New model versions release

### `security-incident.md`
Respond to security findings:
1. Assess severity
2. Disable affected features if critical
3. Apply hotfix
4. Verify fix with tests
5. Deploy and verify
6. Post-mortem

**Use when**: Security vulnerabilities discovered

## Runbook Format

Each runbook follows this structure:

```markdown
# Runbook: Title

## Scenario
When does this situation occur?

## Symptoms
How do you recognize this is happening?

## Prerequisites
What do you need before starting?

## Procedure
Step-by-step instructions:

1. **Step name**: What to do
   - Command or action
   - Expected result
   - What to do if this fails

## Verification
How to confirm the issue is resolved

## Post-Action
Follow-up tasks, documentation updates

## Related
Links to related runbooks, docs, ADRs
```

## Creating New Runbooks

1. Identify repeatable operational procedure
2. Document steps while performing task
3. Test procedure with someone unfamiliar
4. Add to this directory
5. Update this CLAUDE.md index

## Usage

Runbooks are designed for:
- Operations team during incidents
- Developers performing maintenance
- Automated systems (CI/CD, monitoring)

## Integration with Monitoring

When possible, include:
- Alert conditions that trigger this runbook
- Metrics to track during execution
- Success/failure criteria

## Related Documentation

- `docs/troubleshooting/`: Common issues (less formal than runbooks)
- `docs/architecture/`: Background on system design
- `docs/reference/command-reference.md`: Command syntax
