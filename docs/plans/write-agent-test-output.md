# Write-Agent Pattern Test

Generated by: haiku write-agent
Purpose: Verify write-agent pattern works correctly
Date: 2026-02-19

## Test Result

If you can read this file, the write-agent pattern is working correctly.

## What happened

1. Parent skill (Opus) spawned a haiku write-agent via Task tool
2. Haiku write-agent received file content in its prompt
3. Haiku write-agent wrote this file using the Write tool
4. Haiku write-agent returned a compact JSON summary (NOT the file content)
5. Parent skill received: {"file": "...", "lines": N, "status": "ok"}

## Benefits

- Parent response stays under 30 lines (no file content inline)
- Output token limit errors eliminated
- Haiku is 20x cheaper than Opus for mechanical file writing
- Large files (100-500 lines) are generated without truncation
