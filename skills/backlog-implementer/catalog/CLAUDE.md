# Implementer Skill Catalog

## Purpose

Embedded skill definitions for specialized development disciplines. The implementer loads these when creating agent teams for ticket execution.

## Catalog Structure

Each `CAT-*.md` file defines a specialized agent skill with:
- **Name and description**: What the agent does
- **When to use**: Scenarios where this skill applies
- **Core capabilities**: Key competencies and tools
- **Quality standards**: Expected output quality
- **Anti-patterns**: What to avoid

## Available Disciplines

### `CAT-TDD.md`
Test-Driven Development specialist. Creates tests before implementation, ensures red-green-refactor cycles.

**Use for**: New features, bug fixes requiring test coverage

### `CAT-REVIEW.md`
Code review specialist. Performs systematic quality checks, spec compliance, security analysis.

**Use for**: Review gate in implementation pipeline

### `CAT-DEBUG.md`
Debugging and investigation specialist. Systematic problem diagnosis, hypothesis testing, root cause analysis.

**Use for**: BUG tickets, unclear failures, test debugging

### `CAT-SECURITY.md`
Security specialist. Identifies vulnerabilities, enforces secure coding practices, validates authentication/authorization.

**Use for**: SEC tickets, auth changes, payment flows

### `CAT-ARCH.md`
Architecture and design specialist. Evaluates design patterns, ensures maintainability, prevents tech debt.

**Use for**: Refactoring, new system design, architecture reviews

### `CAT-FRONTEND.md`
Frontend specialist. Component design, accessibility, responsive layouts, browser compatibility.

**Use for**: UI tickets, component library, design system work

### `CAT-PERF.md`
Performance optimization specialist. Identifies bottlenecks, optimizes queries, improves response times.

**Use for**: Performance issues, scalability improvements

## How Implementer Uses These

1. **Agent routing**: When implementer creates teams, it selects agent types based on ticket scope
2. **Skill injection**: Selected CAT files are loaded into agent prompts
3. **Quality gates**: Review agents use CAT-REVIEW.md as their standard
4. **Specialized work**: Tickets tagged with types (SEC, PERF) route to specialized agents

## Adding New Disciplines

1. Create `CAT-NAME.md` following existing pattern
2. Define clear use cases and capabilities
3. Include anti-patterns and quality standards
4. Test with sample tickets before deploying
5. Update implementer routing rules in `backlog.config.json`

## Configuration

Agent routing is controlled by `backlog.config.json`:

```json
{
  "agentRouting": {
    "rules": [
      {"pattern": "**/*.tsx", "agentType": "frontend", "catalogSkill": "CAT-FRONTEND"},
      {"pattern": "**/auth/**", "agentType": "backend", "catalogSkill": "CAT-SECURITY"}
    ]
  }
}
```
